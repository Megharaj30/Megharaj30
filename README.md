## About

I am a Computer Engineering undergraduate (2022–2026) with hands-on experience in  
**machine learning pipelines, backend APIs, and full-stack systems**.

Currently working as a **Software Development Intern at Axiometry AI Pvt. Ltd.**,  
where I contribute to data preprocessing, model development, and system integration  
for real-world AI applications.

I care deeply about:
- clean system design  
- reproducible ML workflows  
- production-ready code
